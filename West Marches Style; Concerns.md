**Time**: Skill Training, Shore Leave, Consumption (Food, Water)

**Skill Redundancy**: *look through the character sheet for redundancies and any holes for the scenario*

**Currency**: Are credits worth anything? Are players able to barter with one another, and anyone they are lucky enough to stumble upon within the ship’s remnants?

**PC Starting Loadouts**: Perhaps write some custom d10 tables for each class more suited to the scenario.

**Ammunition**: Standardised or am I prepared to go super granular? Would granular even be *fun* for the players? Probably not..

**PC Death and Significance**: Should consider how a player death would be handled, given the opportunity to create a second character, would players care less about how they approach the maw of the ship? Could there be a limited number of CryoGenerics pods at the beginning of the game. Say 19 or something arbitrary. Players roll their first characters, which will drain supplies innately, through whatever method the players decide, they could wake up other passengers to run several characters at once/post mortem of their initial character.

**Stress and Relief**: PCs require a “safe zone” to recuperate, feed, and rendezvous with other PCs. I imagine this being the Cryobay they begin in, however it could be some sort of jury rigged shelter within a warehousing alcove.

**Questions**: Why are the players here?

## Skill Training

Typically, training skills takes **yonks**.
This feels sub-optimal for keeping such a serial campaign style rolling at a fun pace. Especially if folks are dying left and right *[I hope not]*. 

In many campaign post-mortems, the GMs refer to using tasks such as mission reports/logs as a way to keep the community aware of what other groups of PCs are up to, and rewarding the authors for their efforts.

Rewarding players who scribe their missions with discounted skill training (something like 1/4 off the skill being trained) seems like a strong method of incentivising community while also reducing the amount of downtime players must spend up-skilling themselves.

**Potential Risks** — I cannot discriminate between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ reports. What players write, no matter the quality, will have to yield comparable rewards. This could be countered by requiring reports be rated by other players who were not on the mission (cred. #tim), and once a report has reached a threshold of ratings, the author will receive a discount to the time required to train a skill.

Alternatively, as players use prerequisite skills, they could slowly accrue experience required to redeem or reduce the time spent studying skills.
