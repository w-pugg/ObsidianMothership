Player’s inventories will be tracked physically. This does not mean players may not list or catalogue their belongings in traditional formats, however a player may only carry as much as they can fit in their bags.

## Bags
Each player will have a bag that abstractly represents their carrying capacity. Carrying capacity could include but is not limited to:

- A player’s **Strength** stat.
- Types of clothing (with pockets, etc)
- Duffle bags, satchels, etc

For a player to be comfortably carrying something, it must fit in the bag, representing the object being stowed in a container, slipped into a pocket, holstered, slung, etc. If an object cannot fit inside the bag, the player is either carrying the object by hand (implying one or two-handed weaponry cannot be held) or must be discarded.
