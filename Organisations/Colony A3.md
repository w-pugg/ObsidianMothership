Colony A3 consists of predominantly A-Class passengers who boarded the [[The SOTEIRA Überhauler]] as a part of [[intake 37]]. The colony is housed inside the A3 Cryo-bay (henceforth A3) located near the rear exterior hull of the vessel. 

Due to the exterior nature of A3's location, the many systems and hardware sustaining passengers inside were particularly vulnerable to external, especially celestial, interference. Following a preservative maneuver toward a nearby star, a roguish solar flare disrupted A3 and a number of other surrounding modules causing them to malfunction. Consequently, hundreds of passengers from the Cryo-bay awoke to find themselves staring down the maw of a ravenous cinder sphere, many of which were immediately burnt and blinded.  

Amidst the panic of such a sudden development, those who retained their vision attempted to flee into the ship at-large and away from any external windows, though few actually made it unscathed.
